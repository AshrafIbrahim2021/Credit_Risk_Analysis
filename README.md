# Credit Card Risk Analysis 

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

   using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier models by performing the following:

   - oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
   - undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
   - use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
   - compare two new machine learning models.


## Results:

   Machine Learning Model (Ensembling):
   - Recall is 91% (0.91).

  Machine Learning Model (Resampled):
   - Recall is 99% (0.99).


## Summary:
    Machine Learning Model (Ensembling) has less recall vs Machine Learning Model (Resampled)
